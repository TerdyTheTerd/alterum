# Lobby
The lobby serves as a placeholder for new players and players looking to switch servers. It contains multiple ways to switch servers including commands, a server switcher item and portals the player can enter. Located underneath the Lobby is a collection of network wide leaderboards, stats and recognition boards. Anytime a sub-server goes down for maintenance or needs to restart, players will instead be sent to the Lobby. When a player first joins the server, they will be unable to do anything until they read and accept the rules. After doing so, they will be teleported into the lobby, granted basic permissions and will be able to access the Creative and Minigames servers. The Survival server requires discord linking and will provide instructions to the player when they attempt to join. This process requires the player to send a unqiue pincode to the AlterumNetwork discord bot account, which will automatically link their account and grant them access.

# Survival Server
This is a semi vanilla survival server with a small infusion of mmo/rpg elements. Players can claim land, form Nations, create Clans, purchase plots, setup shops, battle in the mob arena, explore dungeons and complete quest. There is a PVP protected zone within 2.5k blocks of the world spawn to allow peaceful players to enjoy the server. More details on specific features can be found below:

**Land Claiming**
Players can claim land, protecting it from others. When players first join, they will be given a "campsite" in their inventory. Placing this down will claim a temporary chunk of land for 3 days. Once the time is up, the claim expires and so too will the protections. Players will then have to create a land claim with the */claim* command. This will cost $1000 and will claim a 3x3 chunk area around the player. Players can claim additional chunks with each new chunk costing more than the previous. Once a player has claimed land it is now protected from other players. Owners can manage their land claims with the */lands* command, inviting other players, managing permissions and adjusting relations with other Lands. Players can own multiple Lands and be a member of multiple Lands. This should allow for complete flexibility for players to own and manage their own private land claim, while still working with other players in a shared land claim. All land owners will pay a daily upkeep fee based on how large their land is. Lands that cannot afford their upkeep will eventually lose the protection of the claim. The time it takes a claim to become abandoned depends on how long the owner has played on the server for, with a minimum of 3 days. 

**Economy**
The server uses a virtual currency to pay for things. Players can earn money a variety of ways, but these are the primary methods of earning money: 
 - Active Play Time: Players earn money passively just from playing! There is a recurring $50/30m reward, then additional rewards for certain playtime milestones. This is only for active playtime, afk time will not count and players who are afk will not receive any money.
 - Login Rewards: Players can earn Daily, Weekly and Monthly login rewards. These are available at the Survival Spawn and the rewards increase per tier.
 - Mob Hunting: Players can earn money from killing hostile mobs, to a certain limit per timeframe. Mobs in the Mob Arena also drop money.
 - Shops: There are two server shops that allow for infinite selling of Diamonds and Netherite at the Bank. Beyond that players can sell limited quantities of specific items  to different NPS's around spawn, resetting every 4-8 hours.
 - Completing Quest: There are a handful of quest available around spawn. Some are simple and obvious, while others are longer and more complex and may not always be obvious. Most quests reward the players with unique items, experience and money. Most quests are acquired from talking to NPC's
**Quests**
There are a handful of quest scattered around the spawn. Some are simple and easy to complete, while others are more complex and will involve multiple steps, exploration and interactions. Not all quest are immediately available at server launch, and will become available over time.

**Miscellaneous Features:**
 - Player Graves: Drop a grave when you die, protecting your items from theft or destruction for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the items are dropped on the ground
 - Chest Shops: Create a chest shop by sneak clicking a chest with an item and follow the text prompts to create your shop
 - Crawling: Simply sneak when standing in front of 1 block space, or use the /crawl command to start crawling
 - Armored Elytras: Merge you Elytra and Chestplate together in a smithing tablefor the best of both worlds!
 - Access shulker inventory without placing the shulker down!
 - Increase your HP with Heart Cannisters: These can be crafted with rate materials, or acquired as loot from certain bosses
 - Create Hopper filters with item frames

# Creative Server
The creative server is a very basic Plots server. Players can freel purchase plots with currency they have earned from playing on the network. Players can merge plots together, use world edit commands inside their plots and grant other players access to build inside their plot. For a full list of commands available for Plots, please see: [Plot Squared Commands](https://intellectualsites.gitbook.io/plotsquared/features/commands)
A basic guide is as follow:
 - Purchase the plot you are standing in (if its available) with */plot buy*
 - Add a Member to the plot with */plot add <username>* This grans the user build rights to your plot while you are online, otherwise you can trust users with the */plot trust <username>*. This will grant them complete access your plot, even when you are offline
 - Using */plot merge* you can merge together two adjacent plots, assuming you own them both

# Minigames
Under construction, but the plans are to have:
 - Parkour
 - Elytra Race
 - "Lethal Company" inspired randomized loot collector minigame
 - "Chained Together" inspired parkour minigame
