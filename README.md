## Survival Server
This is a semi vanilla survival server with a small infusion of mmo/rpg elements. Players can claim land, form Nations, create Clans, purchase plots, setup shops, battle in the mob arena, explore dungeons and complete quest. There is a PVP protected zone within 2.5k blocks of the world spawn to allow peaceful players to enjoy the server. More details on specific features can be found below:
**Land Claiming**
Players can claim land, protecting it from others. When players first join, they will be given a "campsite" in their inventory. Placing this down will claim a temporary chunk of land for 3 days. Once the time is up, the claim expires and so too will the protections. Players will then have to create a land claim with the */claim* command. This will cost $1000 and will claim a 3x3 chunk area around the player. Players can claim additional chunks with each new chunk costing more than the previous. Once a player has claimed land it is now protected from other players. Owners can manage their land claims with the */lands* command, inviting other players, managing permissions and adjusting relations with other Lands. Players can own multiple Lands and be a member of multiple Lands. This should allow for complete flexibility for players to own and manage their own private land claim, while still working with other players in a shared land claim. All land owners will pay a daily upkeep fee based on how large their land is. Lands that cannot afford their upkeep will eventually lose the protection of the claim. The time it takes a claim to become abandoned depends on how long the owner has played on the server for, with a minimum of 3 days. 

**Economy**
The server uses a virtual currency to pay for things. Players can earn money a variety of ways, but these are the primary methods of earning money: 
 - Active Play Time: Players earn money passively just from playing! There is a recurring $50/30m reward, then additional rewards for certain playtime milestones. This is only for active playtime, afk time will not count and players who are afk will not receive any money.
 - Login Rewards: Players can earn Daily, Weekly and Monthly login rewards. These are available at the Survival Spawn and the rewards increase per tier.
 - Mob Hunting: Players can earn money from killing hostile mobs, to a certain limit per timeframe. Mobs in the Mob Arena also drop money.
 - Shops: There are two server shops that allow for infinite selling of Diamonds and Netherite at the Bank. Beyond that players can sell limited quantities of specific items  to different NPS's around spawn, resetting every 4-8 hours.
 - Completing Quest: There are a handful of quest available around spawn. Some are simple and obvious, while others are longer and more complex and may not always be obvious. Most quests reward the players with unique items, experience and money. Most quests are acquired from talking to NPC's
**Quests**
There are a handful of quest scattered around the spawn. Some are simple and easy to complete, while others are more complex and will involve multiple steps, exploration and interactions. Not all quest are immediately available at server launch, and will become available over time.
